# Guided Composition

This is where things get interesting. Text prompt or image-to-image can only bring you so far, the secret to a masterpiece lies in ControlNets and similar guided compositions.

For most of the workflows in this section you'll need the [ComfyUI's ControlNet Auxiliary Preprocessors extension](https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfyui_controlnet_aux). Be sure to have it installed before going any further.
